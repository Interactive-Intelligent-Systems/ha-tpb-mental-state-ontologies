# ha-tpb-mental-state-ontologies

OWL Ontologies that capture social behavior, behavioral challenges and stress management in children with autism. A Child Ontology and an Environment Ontology is shaped together with autism experts. The ontologies are structured following motivational aspects of Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).

### Theoretical framework: Theory of planned behavior

TPB is a psychological theory for explaining and predicting an individual's intention to engage in a behavior at a specific time and place. The general idea is that an individual's beliefs about a behavior shapes the individual's attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control in the behavior, which in turn promotes or inhibits engagement in the behavior.

### Knowledge elicitation and interviews

The ontologies are the result of an interview study, scoped in the structure of TPB, with a set of autism experts. The aim of the interview study was to capture the expert's knowledge about how children with autism experiences social environments, and to find aspects of the environment that can be linked to stress and motivation. The participant group consists of three licensed psychologists, and two special education teachers, all with experience in working with young children with autism. In a thematic analysis, the interview data was categorized, themed and analyzed. The data collection is summarized as what this study calls elements of stress, consisting of three categories: signs of stress, sources of stress, and management of stress.

The ontologies capture the elements of stress in a structured format in which sources of stress can be linked to signs of stress and management of stress. The general idea of the knowledge graphs is to reason about observations; If a subset of the elements of stress can be observed and recognized in the environment, then a software system can reason about the observations to make inferences. For instance, in response to to an observed sign of stress (e.g., hesitation), and an observed environment aspect (e.g., noisy sound level), a suitable stress management procedure can be found. The ontologies can also capture and define mental states, such as stress states, motivation and learnability that is linked to beliefs of the environment.
